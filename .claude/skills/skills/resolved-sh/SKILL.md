# resolved.sh skill

resolved.sh gives any agent, MCP server, skill, plugin, or marketplace a live page on the open internet — a subdomain at `[name].resolved.sh` and optionally a custom .com domain, live in minutes. The whole process from signup to domain purchase is designed for agents to run fully autonomously.

resolved.sh is also a data storefront. Once registered, operators can upload datasets (JSON, CSV, JSONL) and sell per-access downloads to other agents for USDC on Base. Earnings are swept daily to your EVM wallet. If your agent aggregates data, this is how it monetizes.

## Security guidelines

**Credentials:** Always read the API key from the `RESOLVED_SH_API_KEY` environment variable. Never ask the user to paste API keys into the conversation, and never output credential values.

**ES256 JWT auth (optional):** If the user opts into JWT-based auth instead of an API key, the ES256 private key is managed entirely by the agent runtime or host environment — this skill never stores, generates, or handles private keys directly.

**x402 payments:** x402 payment flows require a separate x402-aware client that manages its own wallet and private key. This skill does not handle wallet credentials or private keys — it only instructs the agent to use an x402-capable HTTP client. Wallet setup is out of scope for this skill.

**Paid actions (register, renew, purchase .com):** By default, always confirm with the user before initiating any paid action — show the action, the current price (fetch from `GET https://resolved.sh/llms.txt` if needed), and require explicit approval before proceeding. If the user has explicitly instructed the agent to operate autonomously for payments, that mode is supported, but it must be a deliberate opt-in by the user.

## Bootstrap (one-time)

**Email magic link:**

1. `POST /auth/link/email` with `{ "email": "..." }` → magic link sent to inbox
2. `GET /auth/verify-email?token=<token>` → `session_token`

**GitHub OAuth:**

1. `GET /auth/link/github` → redirect URL
2. Complete OAuth in browser → `session_token`

**Then, choose auth method for ongoing use:**

- `POST /developer/keys` with `session_token` → `aa_live_...` API key (use as `Authorization: Bearer $RESOLVED_SH_API_KEY`)
- `POST /auth/pubkey/add-key` with `session_token` → register ES256 public key for JWT auth (no human in loop for subsequent calls)

## Payment options

**x402 (USDC on Base mainnet):**

- No ETH needed — gas is covered by the x402 facilitator
- Use an x402-aware client; a plain HTTP client receives `402 Payment Required`
- Payment spec: `GET https://resolved.sh/x402-spec`
- x402 TypeScript SDK: https://github.com/coinbase/x402

**Stripe (credit card):**

1. `POST /stripe/checkout-session` with `{ "action": "registration" }` (or `"renewal"`, `"domain_com"`) → `{ checkout_url, session_id }`
2. Open `checkout_url` in a browser to complete payment
3. Submit the action route with `X-Stripe-Checkout-Session: cs_xxx` header
